                <div class="sectioncontainer">
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>If dysgraphia appears in childhood, it’s usually the result of a problem with orthographic coding. This is an aspect of working memory that allows you to permanently remember written words, 
                            and the way your hands or fingers must move to write those words.</p>
                        <p>With dysgraphia, kids or adults have a harder time planning and executing the writing of sentences, words, and even individual letters. It’s not that you don’t know how to read, spell, or identify letters and words. 
                            Instead, your brain has problems processing words and writing.</p>
                        <p>When dysgraphia develops in adults, the cause is usually a stroke or other brain injury.
                            In particular, injury to the brain’s left parietal lobe may lead to dysgraphia. You have a right and left parietal lobe in the upper part of your brain. Each is associated with a range of skills, such as reading and writing, 
                            as well as sensory processing, including pain, heat, and cold.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Occupational therapy may be helpful in improving handwriting skills. Therapeutic activities may include:</p>
                        <ul class="ml-3">
                            <li>holding a pencil or pen in a new way to make writing easier</li>
                            <li>working with modeling clay</li>
                            <li>tracing letters in shaving cream on a desk</li>
                            <li>drawing lines within mazes</li>
                            <li>doing connect-the-dots puzzles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are also several writing programs that can help children and adults form letters and sentences neatly on paper.</p><br/>
                        <p>If other learning disabilities or health issues are present, treatment options will need to address those conditions as well.
                            Medications may be needed to treat ADHD, for example.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-3">Living with Dysgraphia</h3>
                    <p>For some people, occupational therapy and motor skills training can help improve their writing ability. For others, it remains a lifelong challenge.</p>
                    <p>If you have a son or daughter with dysgraphia, it’s important to work with your child’s school and 
                        teachers on accommodations that are appropriate for this type of learning disability.
                        Some classroom strategies that may help include:</p>
                        <ul class="ml-3">
                            <li>a designated note taker in the classroom</li>
                            <li>use of a computer for notes and other assignments</li>
                            <li>oral exams and assignments, instead of written ones</li>
                            <li>extra time on tests and assignments</li>
                            <li>lesson or lecture notes provided by the teacher as printouts, recordings, or in digital form</li>
                            <li>use of wide-ruled or graph paper</li>
                        </ul><br/>
                        <p>And if you feel that the treatment you or children receive for dysgraphia isn’t sufficient, don’t give up. 
                            Look for other therapists or resources in your community that may help. You may need to be an aggressive advocate for your child,
                            but keep in mind that there are laws and school policies designed to serve students with all types of learning challenges.</p>
